# Instagram_marketing_demo
A data analysis demonstration to walk through some of skills employed to perform exploratory data analysis on a segment of a dataset. 

Summary of Analysis:

This analysis explores Instagram influencers' follower data to identify potential marketing targets. The dataset was initially filtered to see the number of categories used across the dataset, which was music. Then taking the total number of followers per category and seeing how music stood up against other categories and finally the total number of followers. 

From there I broke it down further to look at just accounts in the United States and refined it further by looking into "Sports with a ball," and performed the following.

*Descriptive Statistics:* Key statistics such as the mean and distribution of followers were analyzed. A bell curve was generated to visualize the distribution of followers, revealing a range that skews toward a few high-profile influencers with very large followings.

*Targeting Recommendations:* The data indicates that well-known influencers like LeBron James and Tom Brady dominate the follower count. However, a broader strategy might be beneficial, targeting mid-tier influencers for cost-effective marketing. This would require expanding the dataset to include more influencers beyond the top-tier accounts.
